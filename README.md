# Sample-Code

These are the sample code which are used again and again in development. So I thought to develop them .
I have make code which helps developers so they don't have wo worry about professional code.

The biggest advantage is that these all codes are global So you can use them in any situtation and modify them easily.
I believe that if you give more than a client exceptation then you are best developer in the world.

I see a lot of coders does't folllow standard approach when they are coding.
But I try to follow I work in a freelancing based company so we don't have enough time to think and act. We just make things working.
